# DNS

To test the program, run `host -p 9000 foo.bar.com 127.0.0.1`

## Format

* A more detailed explanation of DNS message format can be found [here](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_DNSMessageProcessingandGeneralMessageFormat.htm).

* The client/server information exchange in DNS is facilitated using query/response messaging. Both queries and responses have the same general format, containing up to five individual sections carrying information.

* Of these, two are usually found in both queries and responses: the Header section and the Question section.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>QR</td>
            <td>1/8 (1 bit)</td>

                Specify the type of query. Valid values are 0(query), 1(iquery), 2(status), 3(reserved), 4(notify) and 5(update).
                A server should copy this value unchanged from a query to a response.</td>

            <td>1/8 (1 bit)</td>
            <td>Truncation flag: Setting to 1 indicates that the message was truncated due to its length being longer than the maximum permitted for the type of transport mechanism used. Since TCP doesn't have a length limit, this option is applicable to UDP only</td>

            <td>RD</td>
            <td>1/8 (1 bit)</td>
            <td>Recursion Desired flag: When set in a query, requests that the server receiving the query attempt to answer the query recursively, if the server supports recursive resolution. The value of this bit is not changed in the response.</td>

            <td>RA</td>
            <td>1/8 (1 bit)</td>

                Question Count: Specifies the number of questions in the Question section of the message. Theoretically,
                DNS protocol supports multiple questions in one query. In reality, however, this seems to be not
                supported by mainstream implementations as shown <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4082081/requesting-a-and-aaaa-records-in-single-dns-query/4083071">here</a>.

            <td>2</td>

                Question Name: Contains the object, domain or zone name that is the subject of the query, encoded using standard DNS name notation.
                The "standard DNS name notation" encodes www.google.com to 3www6google3com0.
