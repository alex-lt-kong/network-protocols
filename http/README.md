# Notes

* HTTP is a complex protocol, [RFC2616 -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616) is 175 pages long.

* Server-side programs in this directory could be inefficient, insecure or unstable--they are just a few simple
  experiments roughly demonstrating how HTTP works.
